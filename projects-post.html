		    							<p>Let’s say that a form of ‘rationalisation’ or simplification, linked to the emerging market economy, to the privatization and dismemberment of common lands and to colonial appropriation, helped to prepare the way. As ever, it is difficult to know which came first, the chicken or the egg, and that also goes for the Neolithic revolution. Prehistorians are divided on whether it was settlement that led humans to master the energy convertors that are animals and plants, or if it was the other way around, if humans settled because they had begun to cultivate and to farm livestock. I have neither the means nor the will to resolve this question. However, what we do see is that there is some degree of interaction between the two phenomena. In the same way during the industrial revolution there was an interaction between the simplification of intense agriculture generated by monoculture, and this other simplification that took the form of the economies of scale that were enabled by the use of high-density energies. The changes that affect agriculture and industry are analogous. There is a concomitance, without being able to say which one made the other possible.</p>
